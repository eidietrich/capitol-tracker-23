# Montana Free Press 2023 Capitol Tracker

This project is an effort to make the quantifiable aspects of the Montana Legislature more accessible to the public by compiling information about lawmakers, proposed bills and the legislative process. This is an effort of [Montana Free Press](http://montanafreepress.org/), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit newsroom that aims to provide Montanans with in-depth, nonpartisan news coverage.

A live version of this project is available at https://apps.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2023/.

The information presented here via is collected from a variety of sources including the Montana Legislatureâ€™s public roster and its official bill-tracking system, the [Legislative Automated Workflow System](http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/law0203w$.startup?P_SESS=20211), or LAWS. Reporting and web design was done primarily by MTFP data reporter Eric Dietrich. Please contact him at edietrich@montanafreepress.org with bug reports, questions or suggestions.

Bill tracking data from the LAWS system collected via a GitHub Actions-powered scraper housed in a separate repository, https://github.com/eidietrich/laws-interface.
