{"text":"The 2023 Legislature is the second session of Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte's first term.\n\nThe governor appoints state agency heads and is ultimately responsible for the day-to-day management of government. The governor also prepares a budget proposal that serves as a starting point for the legislative appropriations process, where lawmakers determine how much the governorâ€™s executive branch is allowed to spend.\n\nBills passed by the Legislature are sent to the governor, who can sign them into law, issue a veto, or let them become law without his signature. Vetos can be overridden by two-thirds majority votes in both the House and Senate.","articles":[{"title":"Medicaid and abortion top health agenda for Montana lawmakers","category":"Health Care","subtitle":"","date":"2023-01-09T23:32:48.000Z","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/01/09/medicaid-and-abortion-top-health-agenda-for-montana-lawmakers/","author":"Stephanie Farmer","imageUrl":"https://montanafreepress.org/untitled-design-238/","billTags":[],"lawmakerTags":["Matt Regier","Ryan Lynch"],"governorTags":["Greg Gianforte"]},{"title":"Gianforte budget proposal puts state surplus toward tax cuts, infrastructure and Montana State Hospital","category":"State Government","subtitle":"","date":"2022-11-11T01:19:17.000Z","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2022/11/10/gianforte-2023-budget-proposal-tax-cuts-infrastructure-state-hospital/","author":"Mara Silvers","imageUrl":"https://montanafreepress.org/2022/11/10/gianforte-2023-budget-proposal-tax-cuts-infrastructure-state-hospital/2022-11-10-gianforte-budget-press-conference/","billTags":[],"lawmakerTags":[],"governorTags":["Greg Gianforte"]}]}
