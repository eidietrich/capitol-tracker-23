  "GovernorPageText": "The 2023 Legislature is the second session of Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte's first term.\n\nThe governor appoints state agency heads and is ultimately responsible for the day-to-day management of government. The governor also prepares a budget proposal that serves as a starting point for the legislative appropriations process, where lawmakers determine how much the governor’s executive branch is allowed to spend.\n\nBills passed by the Legislature are sent to the governor, who can sign them into law, issue a veto, or let them become law without his signature. Vetos can be overridden by two-thirds majority votes in both the House and Senate."
